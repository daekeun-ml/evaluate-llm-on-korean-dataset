agricultural_sciences,D,,"질문 (Question): 어떤 유기용제 50리터가 토양으로 유출되었다. 이로 인해 발생된 오염 지하수의 부피는 100m3이었고 지하수내 유기용제의 농도는 90mg/L이었다. 유기용제의 밀도가 0.9g/mL일 때 토양내 잔존하는 유기용제의 부피(리터)는? (단, 유기용제의 분해는 고려하지 않음)
보기 (Options):
A: 25, B: 30, C: 35, D: 40
정답 (Answer): 

먼저, 지하수 내 유기용제의 총량을 계산합니다.
지하수의 부피는 100m³ = 100,000L입니다.
유기용제의 농도는 90mg/L입니다.
따라서, 지하수 내 유기용제의 총량은 100,000L * 90mg/L = 9,000,000mg = 9,000g입니다.

유기용제의 밀도는 0.9g/mL이므로, 이를 부피로 변환하면:
9,000g / 0.9g/mL = 10,000mL = 10L입니다.

유출된 유기용제의 총량은 50L이므로, 토양 내 잔존하는 유기용제의 부피는:
50L - 10L = 40L입니다.

따라서, 정답은 D입니다."

보기 (Options):
A: 5.40, B: 16.90, C: 23.90, D: 33.81
정답 (Answer): 

이 문제를 풀기 위해서는 양력 방정식을 사용해야 합니다. 양력 방정식은 다음과 같습니다:

\[ L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L \]

여기서:
- \( L \)은 양력 (Lift)
- \( \rho \)는 공기 밀도 (Density of air)
- \( v \)는 속도 (Velocity)
- \( S \)는 날개 면적 (Wing area)
- \( C_L \)는 양력 계수 (Lift coefficient)

주어진 값들을 대입하여 계산해보겠습니다:
- \( L = 200 \, \text{kgf} \approx 200 \times 9.81 \, \text{N} = 1962 \, \text{N} \)
- \( \rho = 1.225 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)
- \( C_L = 1.4 \)
- 날개의 가로세로비가 8이고 시의 길이가 0.5m이므로 날개 면적 \( S \)는 \( 8 \times 0.5^2 = 2 \, \text{m}^2 \)

양력 방정식을 속도 \( v \)에 대해 풀면:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2L}{\rho S C_L}} \]

값을 대입하여 계산하면:

\[ v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 1962}{1.225 \times 2 \times 1.4}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{3924}{3.43}} \approx \sqrt{1144} \approx 33.81 \, \text{m/s} \]

따라서 정답은 D입니다."

aviation_engineering_and_maintenance,D,A,"질문 (Question): 터보제트 기관에서 저발열량이 12,000㎉ /㎏인 연료를 1초 동안에 0.13㎏씩 소모한다고 할 때, 추력 비연료소비율 (TSFC)은? (단, 진추력(Fn)= 6000kg.m/s2.N, 비행속도(Va)=200m/s)
보기 (Options):
A: 추진효율= 0.76, B: 추진효율= 0.16, C: 추진효율= 0.20, D: 추진효율= 0.08
정답 (Answer): 

이 질문은 주어진 정보로부터 TSFC를 계산해야 하는 문제입니다. TSFC는 연료 소비율을 추력으로 나눈 값입니다. 그러나 주어진 보기들은 TSFC가 아닌 추진효율을 나타내고 있습니다. 따라서, 주어진 정보로부터 추진효율을 계산해야 합니다.

추진효율(η)은 다음과 같이 계산할 수 있습니다:
\[ \eta = \frac{2 \cdot Va \cdot Fn}{\dot{m_f} \cdot Q} \]

여기서,
- \( Va \) = 비행속도 = 200 m/s
- \( Fn \) = 진추력 = 6000 N
- \( \dot{m_f} \) = 연료 소비율 = 0.13 kg/s
- \( Q \) = 연료의 저발열량 = 12,000 kcal/kg = 12,000 * 4,184 J/kg (1 kcal = 4,184 J)

계산을 통해 추진효율을 구하면:
\[ \eta = \frac{2 \cdot 200 \cdot 6000}{0.13 \cdot 12,000 \cdot 4,184} \]

\[ \eta = \frac{2,400,000}{6,518,400} \approx 0.368 \]

따라서, 주어진 보기 중 가장 가까운 값은 없습니다. 그러나, 만약 주어진 보기 중에서 가장 근접한 값을 선택해야 한다면, 정답은 A: 추진효율= 0.76이 될 수 있습니다.
