Ecology,C,,"질문에 주어진 정보를 바탕으로 합리식을 이용하여 최대 홍수 유량을 계산할 수 있습니다. 합리식은 다음과 같습니다:

\[ Q = C \cdot I \cdot A \]

여기서,
- \( Q \)는 유량 (m³/sec)
- \( C \)는 유출계수
- \( I \)는 강우 강도 (m/sec)
- \( A \)는 유역면적 (m²)

주어진 값들을 대입해 보겠습니다:
- 유출계수 \( C = 0.80 \)
- 강우 강도 \( I = 90 \) mm/hr = \( 90 \times 10^{-3} \) m/hr = \( 90 \times 10^{-3} / 3600 \) m/sec
- 유역면적 \( A = 10 \) ha = \( 10 \times 10^4 \) m²

계산을 해보면:
\[ I = \frac{90 \times 10^{-3}}{3600} = 2.5 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m/sec} \]
\[ A = 10 \times"

Agricultural-Sciences,D,,"질문에서 주어진 정보를 바탕으로 처리해야 할 토양의 양을 계산해 보겠습니다.

1. 오염된 토양의 부피를 계산합니다:
\[ \text{부피} = 20m \times 25m \times 3m = 1500m^3 \]

2. 토양의 단위용적 밀도를 주어진 단위로 변환합니다:
\[ 1.8g/cm^3 = 1.8 \times 10^3 kg/m^3 \]

3. 오염된 토양의 총 질량을 계산합니다:
\[ \text{질량} = \text{부피} \times \text{단위용적 밀도} = 1500m^3 \times 1.8 \times 10^3 kg/m^3 = 2.7 \times 10^6 kg \]

따라서, 처리해야 할 토양의 양은 2.7 × 10^6 kg입니다.

정답은 D입니다."
