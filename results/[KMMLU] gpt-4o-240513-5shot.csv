계산 과정:
오염 대수층의 체적 = 20000 m³
매질의 공극률 = 0.3
오염운 내 지하수의 평균 TCE 농도 = 1.0 mg/L

먼저, 오염된 지하수의 체적을 계산합니다:
오염된 지하수의 체적 = 대수층 체적 × 공극률 = 20000 m³ × 0.3 = 6000 m³

1 m³ = 1000 L 이므로, 오염된 지하수의 체적을 리터로 변환합니다:
6000 m³ × 1000 L/m³ = 6000000 L

오염운의 지하수 내 존재하는 TCE 총량을 계산합니다:
TCE 총량 = 오염된 지하수의 체적 × TCE 농도 = 6000000 L × 1.0 mg/L = 6000000 mg

1 kg = 1000000 mg 이므로, TCE 총량을 킬로그램으로 변환합니다:
6000000 mg ÷ 1000000 mg/kg = 6.0 kg

따라서, 정답은 D: 6.0 kg입니다."

보기 (Options):
A: 추진효율= 0.76, B: 추진효율= 0.16, C: 추진효율= 0.20, D: 추진효율= 0.08
정답 (Answer): 

이 질문은 주어진 정보로부터 TSFC를 계산하는 문제입니다. TSFC는 연료 소비율을 추력으로 나눈 값입니다. 그러나 주어진 보기들은 TSFC가 아닌 추진효율을 나타내고 있습니다. 따라서, 주어진 정보로는 정확한 답을 도출하기 어렵습니다. 

추진효율을 계산하려면 다음 공식을 사용해야 합니다:
\[ \eta = \frac{2 \cdot Va}{Va + \sqrt{Va^2 + 2 \cdot \frac{Fn}{\dot{m}}}} \]

여기서:
- \( Va \)는 비행속도 (200 m/s)
- \( Fn \)은 진추력 (6000 N)
- \( \dot{m} \)은 연료 소비율 (0.13 kg/s)

하지만, 이 공식은 주어진 보기와 일치하지 않습니다. 따라서, 주어진 정보로는 정확한 답을 도출하기 어렵습니다."

Civil-Engineering,D,C,"질문 (Question): 강구강도 , 유역면적 4㎢, 유입시간 5min, 유출계수 C=0.85, 관내유속 1.2m/sec, 관 길이 1000m인 하수관에 유출되는 우수량을 합리식 (Rational Method)을 구한 값은? (단, 강우지속시간(t[분])은 유달시간과 같다.)
보기 (Options):
A: 68.08m3/sec, B: 78.08m3/sec, C: 88.08m3/sec, D: 98.08m3/sec
정답 (Answer): 

정답을 계산하기 위해서는 합리식(Rational Method)을 사용해야 합니다. 합리식은 다음과 같습니다:

\[ Q = C \cdot I \cdot A \]

여기서,
- \( Q \)는 유출량 (m³/sec)
- \( C \)는 유출계수
- \( I \)는 강우강도 (mm/hr)
- \( A \)는 유역면적 (km²)

주어진 값들을 사용하여 계산을 진행합니다.

1. 유출계수 \( C = 0.85 \)
2. 유역면적 \( A = 4 \) km²
3. 유입시간 \( t = 5 \) 분
4. 관내유속 \( v = 1.2 \) m/sec
5. 관 길이 \( L = 1000 \) m

강우지속시간이 유달시간과 같다고 했으므로, 유달시간을 계산합니다:
\[ t_d = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{1000 \, \text{m}}{1.2 \, \text{m/sec}} = 833.33 \, \text{sec} = 13.89 \, \text{min} \]

그러나 문제에서 유입시간을 5분으로 주었으므로, 강우지속시간은 5분으로 사용합니다.

강우강도 \( I \)를 구하기 위해서는 강우강도-지속시간 곡선이 필요하지만, 주어진 정보로는 직접 계산이 어렵습니다. 따라서 주어진 보기 중에서 가장 적절한 값을 선택해야 합니다.

정답은 주어진 보기 중에서 가장 적절한 값을 선택해야 하므로, 주어진 보기 중에서 가장 적절한 값을 선택해야 합니다.

계산 과정:
1. 10cm × 10cm × 6m 부재 10개:
   - 부피: 0.1m × 0.1m × 6m = 0.06m³
   - 총 부피: 0.06m³ × 10개 = 0.6m³

2. 15cm × 10cm × 6m 부재 10개:
   - 부피: 0.15m × 0.1m × 6m = 0.09m³
   - 총 부피: 0.09m³ × 10개 = 0.9m³

3. 총 부피: 0.6m³ + 0.9m³ = 1.5m³

4. 목재 10m³는 300재이므로, 1m³는 30재:
   - 1.5m³는 1.5 × 30재 = 45재

5. 목재 1재의 가격은 1,000원이므로:
   - 45재 × 1,000원 = 45,000원

따라서, 사용된 목재의 재료비는 450,000원입니다."

보기 (Options):
A: 4.4, B: 6.4, C: 8.4, D: 10.4
정답 (Answer): 

이 문제를 해결하기 위해서는 강관의 열용량과 증기의 증발잠열을 고려하여 응축수량을 계산해야 합니다. 

1. 강관의 열용량 계산:
   - 강관의 질량: 300 kg
   - 강관의 비열: 0.46 kJ/kg·℃
   - 온도 변화: 104.25℃ (포화온도) - 0℃ (외부온도) = 104.25℃
   - 강관의 열용량 = 질량 × 비열 × 온도 변화
   = 300 kg × 0.46 kJ/kg·℃ × 104.25℃
   = 14409 kJ

2. 응축수량 계산:
   - 증발잠열: 2245 kJ/kg
   - 응축수량 = 강관의 열용량 / 증발잠열
   = 14409 kJ / 2245 kJ/kg
   ≈ 6.42 kg

따라서, 트랩 선정에 필요한 응축수량은 약 6.4 kg입니다.

보기 (Options):
A: 1,020kN, B: 920kN, C: 950kN, D: 860kN
정답 (Answer): 

정답을 계산하기 위해서는 다음 공식을 사용해야 합니다:
\[ \text{전압축력} = 0.85 \times f_{ck} \times b \times a \]

여기서:
- \( f_{ck} = 30 \, \text{MPa} \)
- \( b = 400 \, \text{mm} = 0.4 \, \text{m} \)
- \( a = 100 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{m} \)

따라서:
\[ \text{전압축력} = 0.85 \times 30 \, \text{MPa} \times 0.4 \, \text{m} \times 0.1 \, \text{m} \]
\[ \text{전압축력} = 0.85 \times 30 \times 0.4 \times 0.1 \]
\[ \text{전압축력} = 1.02 \, \text{MN} \]
\[ \text{전압축력} = 1,020 \, \text{kN} \]

따라서 정답은 A입니다."

Materials-Engineering,C,,"질문 (Question): 강판의 두께 t=10mm인 재료로 지름 d=1m인 밀폐 원통형 탱크를 만들어 내압 P=24.5MPa을 작용시킬 때 이 탱크의 벽에 발생하는 최대 전단변형 γ 는? (단, 탄성계수 E=205.8 GPa, 포아송비 °=0.3이다.)
보기 (Options):
A: 0.001, B: 0.002, C: 0.004, D: 0.006
정답 (Answer): 

이 문제는 복잡한 계산을 필요로 하며, 주어진 정보로부터 최대 전단변형을 구하는 공식과 단계를 통해 답을 도출해야 합니다. 그러나 주어진 정보만으로는 직접적인 계산을 수행하기 어렵습니다. 따라서, 정답을 제공하기 위해서는 추가적인 계산이 필요합니다. 

일반적으로, 최대 전단변형 γ는 다음과 같은 식을 통해 구할 수 있습니다:
\[ \gamma = \frac{\tau}{G} \]
여기서 \(\tau\)는 전단응력, \(G\)는 전단탄성계수입니다. 전단탄성계수 \(G\)는 다음과 같이 구할 수 있습니다:
\[ G = \frac{E}{2(1 + \nu)} \]

주어진 값들을 대입하면:
\[ G = \frac{205.8 \text{ GPa}}{2(1 + 0.3)} = \frac{205.8}{2.6} \approx 79.15 \text{ GPa} \]

전단응력 \(\tau\)는 내압 \(P\)와 관련이 있으며, 원통형 탱크의 경우 다음과 같은 식을 사용할 수 있습니다:
\[ \tau = \frac{P \cdot d}{2t} \]

주어진 값들을 대입하면:
\[ \tau = \frac{24.5 \text{ MPa} \cdot 1 \text{ m}}{2 \cdot 0.01 \text{ m}} = \frac{24.5 \cdot 10^6 \text{ Pa} \cdot 1}{0.02} = 1.225 \cdot 10^9 \text{ Pa} \]

따라서 최대 전단변형 \(\gamma\)는:
\[ \gamma = \frac{1.225 \cdot 10^9 \text{ Pa}}{79.15 \cdot 10^9 \text{ Pa}} \approx 0.0155 \]

이 값은 주어진 보기 중에 없으므로, 주어진 보기 중 가장 근접한 값을 선택해야 합니다. 가장 근접한 값은:
\[ D: 0.006 \]

따라서 정답은 D입니다."
