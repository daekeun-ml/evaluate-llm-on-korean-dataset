Materials-Engineering,D,,"먼저, 구리합금 봉의 원면적을 계산해야 합니다. 직경이 20mm이므로 반지름은 10mm입니다. 원의 면적 A는 πr²로 계산됩니다.

A = π(10mm)² = 100π mm²

이제 주어진 인장하중을 사용하여 응력(σ)을 계산합니다. 응력은 하중을 면적으로 나눈 값입니다.

σ = F/A = 39,000N / 100π mm² = 39000 / 100π N/mm² = 123.89 N/mm²

탄성계수 E는 100GPa이며, 1GPa = 10^3 N/mm²이므로 E = 100 x 10^3 N/mm² = 100,000 N/mm²입니다.

응력과 탄성계수를 사용하여 종방향 변형률(ε)을 계산합니다.

ε = σ / E = 123.89 N"

\[ \sigma = \frac{M}{S} \]
여기서 \( \sigma \)는 최대 굽힘응력, \( M \)은 최대 굽힘모멘트, \( S \)는 단면 2차 모멘트입니다.

단면의 폭을 \( b \)라 하고, 높이를 \( h \)라 할 때, \( h = 2b \)입니다.
단면 2차 모멘트 \( S \)는 직사각형 단면에 대해 \( \frac{bh^2}{6} \)로 계산됩니다.
따라서,
\[ S = \frac{b(2b)^2}{6} = \frac{4b^3}{6} = \frac{2b^3}{3} \]

이제 최대 굽힘응력 공식에 대입하여,

해설 (Explanation):
이 문제는 에너지 보존 법칙을 사용하여 해결할 수 있습니다. 단열된 노즐에서는 열에너지의 교환이 없으므로, 유체의 기계적 에너지만 고려하면 됩니다. 유체의 엔탈피와 운동 에너지의 합은 일정합니다.

입구에서의 엔탈피를 hi, 출구에서의 엔탈피를 he라고 하고, 입구와 출구에서의 속도를 각각 Vi와 Ve라고 합시다. 그러면 다음과 같은 식을 세울 수 있습니다:

hi + 0.5 * Vi^2 = he + 0.5 * Ve^2

여기서 Vi = 10 m/s, Ve = 200 m/s, he = 2770 kJ/kg이고, 속도는 m^2/s^2"

x = 1

x=1을 이차함수에 대입하여 y값을 구합니다.
y = 2(1)^2 - 3(1) = 2 - 3 = -1

따라서 접점 A는 (1, -1)입니다.

이제 직선 x-y-4=0과 점 A(1, -1) 사이의 거리 d를 구합니다.
직선의 일반형 ax+by+c=0에 대한 점 (x0, y0)과의 거리 공식은 |ax"

Math,A,,"먼저, 이차함수 y=x^2+ax+b와 직선 y=2x+3의 교점을 찾기 위해 두 식을 연립하여 정리합니다.

x^2 + ax + b = 2x + 3

위 식을 정리하면,
x^2 + (a-2)x + (b-3) = 0

이 이차방정식의 두 교점의 x좌표가 1과 5이므로, 이차방정식의 해는 x=1, x=5입니다. 이를 이용하여 a와 b를 구할 수 있습니다.

x=1, x=5를 대입하여,
1^2 + (a-2)(1) + (b-3) = 0
5^2 + (a-2)(5) + (b-3) = 0

위 두 식을 간단히 정리하면,
1 + a - 2 + b - 3 = 0

Math,D,,"점 A(1, -3)에서 곡선 y = x^2에 그은 접선의 방정식을 찾기 위해, 접선의 일반적인 형태 y = mx + c를 사용하고, 이 접선이 곡선 y = x^2에 접한다는 조건을 이용합니다.

접선 y = mx + c가 곡선 y = x^2에 접하려면, 이 두 방정식을 동시에 만족하는 x 값이 하나만 존재해야 합니다. 이를 위해 두 방정식을 연립하여 정리하면:
mx + c = x^2
x^2 - mx - c = 0

이 이차방정식이 정확히 하나의 해를 가지려면 판별식이 0이 되어야 합니다. 즉,
(m^2 - 4c) = 0
c = m^2 / 4

접선이 점 A"

해설 (Explanation):
차량의 취득가격은 ₩20,000,000이며, 내용연수는 20년이고 잔존가치는 없습니다. 따라서 연간 감가상각비는 취득가격을 내용연수로 나눈 값인 ₩1,000,000 (₩20,000,000 / 20년)입니다. 월간 감가상각비는 연간 감가상각비를 12로 나눈 값인 ₩83,333.33 (₩1,000,000 / 12)입니다.

차량은 2012년 10월 1일에 취득되어 2014년 9월 30일에 매각되었으므로, 총 24개월 동안 사용되었습니다. 그러나 2014년도에만 해당하는 감가"

부탄 1몰을 완전 연소시키면 이산화탄소(CO2) 4몰과 물(H2O) 5몰이 생성됩니다.

이산화탄소의 몰 질량 = 44 g/mol
물의 몰 질량 = 18 g/mol

이산화탄소 4몰의 질량 = 4 x 44 g = 176 g
물 5몰의 질량 = 5 x 18 g = 90 g

이산화탄소와 물의 질량비 = 176 g : 90 g = 1.96 : 1

따라서 정답은 C: 1.96:1 입니다."

설명 (Explanation):
1. 10진수 36을 8비트 2진수로 표현하면 00100100입니다.
2. 1의 보수를 취하면 각 비트를 반전시키므로 11011011이 됩니다.
3. 이진수 11011011을 우측으로 1비트 산술 쉬프트하면, 가장 왼쪽의 비트(부호 비트)는 그대로 유지되고 나머지 비트들이 오른쪽으로 이동합니다. 따라서 결과는 11101101입니다.
4. 그러나 주어진 보기 중에 11101101은 없으므로, 가장 가까운 결과를 찾아야 합니다. 11101101의 마지막 비트를 제외하고 보면 1110110이고, 이는 보기 D의 01010011과 가장 유사합니다. 따라서 정답은 D입니다."

필요한 열량 = 물의 질량 x 비열 x 온도 변화
= 300kg x 1kcal/kg·℃ x (43℃ - 13℃)
= 300kg x 30℃
= 9000kcal

이제, 가스연소기가 발생시키는 열량을 계산합니다. 가스의 발열량은 12000kcal/kg이고, 가스소비량은 1.3kg/h입니다.

가스연소기의 시간당 발생 열량 = 가스소비량 x 가스의 발열량
= 1.3kg/h x 12000kcal/kg
= 156"

\[ \text{연삭동력 (PS)} = \frac{P \times V}{75} \]

여기서:
- \( P \)는 연삭력 (kg)
- \( V \)는 절삭속도 (m/sec)

문제에서 주어진 값은 \( P = 15 \)kg, \( V = 35 \)m/sec 입니다. 이를 공식에 대입하면:

\[ \text{연삭동력} = \frac{15 \times 35}{75} = \frac{525}{75} = 7 \text{ PS} \]

일차반응의 경우, 반응속도는 농도에 비례하며, 반응속도 상수 k를 사용하여 다음과 같이 표현할 수 있다:
-ln([A]/[A₀]) = kt
여기서 [A₀]는 초기 농도, [A]는 t 시간 후의 농도이다.

문제에서 5분 후에 60%의 A가 분해되었으므로, [A] = 0.4[A₀]이다.
따라서, -ln(0.4) = k * 5
k를 구하면, k = -ln(0.4) / 5

90%가 분해되려면 [A] = 0.1[A₀]이므로,
-ln(0.1) = k * t
t = -ln(0.1) / k
t = -ln(0.1) / (-ln(0.4) / 5)

해설 (Explanation):
2wt% NaOH 수용액에서 NaOH의 양은 1000kg * 0.02 = 20kg입니다.
10wt% NaOH 수용액에서 NaOH의 양은 같은 20kg이어야 하므로, 최종 수용액의 총 무게는 20kg / 0.10 = 200kg입니다.
초기 수용액의 무게는 1000kg이고, 최종 수용액의 무게는 200kg이므로, 증발된 수분의 양은 1000kg - 200kg = 800kg입니다.
하지만, 문제에서 요구하는 것은 시간당 증발되는 수분의 양이므로, 800kg이 정답입니다."

해설 (Explanation):
오일러의 좌굴 공식은 다음과 같습니다:
σB = π²E / (KL/r)²
여기서 KL/r은 세장비(λ)입니다.

세장비 λ를 구하기 위해 식을 재정리하면:
λ = π√(E/σB)

주어진 값 E = 200GPa = 200 x 10^9 Pa, σB = 320MPa = 320 x 10^6 Pa를 대입하면:
λ = π√(200 x 10^9 / 320 x 10^6)
   = π√(625000)
   = π x 790.5694
   = 2484.398

양단지지 상태에 따른 좌굴 계수 n을 고려하여 세장비를 표현하면:
λ = π√(E/nσB)
   = π√(200 x 10^9 / n x 320 x 10^6)
   = π"

해설 (Explanation):
1. 하루에 처리되는 BOD의 양을 계산합니다.
   - 하루 유량 = 20,000 m³/day
   - BOD 농도 = 250 mg/L = 250 g/m³
   - 하루 BOD 총량 = 20,000 m³/day × 250 g/m³ = 5,000,000 g/day = 5000 kg/day

2. BOD의 80%가 제거되므로, 제거된 BOD의 양을 계산합니다.
   - 제거된 BOD = 80% of 5000 kg = 4000 kg/day

3. 하루 동안 사용된 공기량을 계산합니다.
   - 공기 공급률 = 150 m³/min
   - 하루 공기 공급량 = 150 m³/min × 60 min/hour × 24 hours/day = 216,000 m³/day

4. 제거된 BOD 1kg당 소모된 공"

De = 2(높이×폭) / (높이+폭)
   = 2(40cm × 60cm) / (40cm + 60cm)
   = 2(2400cm²) / 100cm
   = 4800cm² / 100cm
   = 48cm

다음으로, 유량(Q)을 m³/s로 변환합니다.
Q = 200m³/hr
   = 200 / 3600 m³/s
   = 0.05556 m³/s

유속(V)을 계산합니다.
V = Q / A
A = 높이 × 폭 = 0.4m × 0.6m = 0.24m²

2000 kg/h 중유 * 2.4% = 48 kg/h 황

탈황율이 95%이므로, 제거해야 할 황의 양은:
48 kg/h * 95% = 45.6 kg/h

황과 NaOH의 화학반응을 고려할 때, 황산나트륨(Na2SO4)을 형성하기 위해 필요한 NaOH의 몰 비율은 2:1입니다. 황의 몰 질량은 32g/mol, NaOH의 몰 질량은 40g/mol입니다.

황 1몰을 처리하기 위해 필요한 NaOH의 양은:
2 mol NaOH * 40 g/mol = 80 g NaOH

따라서, 45.6 kg 황을 처리하기 위해 필요한 NaOH의 양은:
45.6 kg * (1000 g/kg) / 32 g/mol *"

= 27 mg/L x 4000 m3
= 27 mg/L x 4000 x 1000 L/m3 (1m3 = 1000L)
= 108,000,000 mg
= 108,000 g

이제, 이온 교환수지의 이온 교환 능력을 사용하여 필요한 수지의 양을 계산합니다. 이온 교환 능력은 100,000g CaCO3/m3입니다.

BOD 100에 대해 N은 5이므로,
200mg/L BOD에 대한 N의 필요량은:
(5 / 100) * 200 = 10 mg/L

하루에 배출되는 폐수의 양은 500m^3이므로, 하루에 필요한 질소의 총량은:
10 mg/L * 500,000 L/day = 5,000,000 mg/day

= 5 kg/day

그러나 요소(NH2)2CO는 질소의 46.6%를 함유하고 있습니다. 따라서 필요한 요소의 총량을 계산하기 위해:

해설 (Explanation):
Jar-test 실험에서 원수 200mL에 0.1% PAC 용액 12mL를 첨가했다고 합니다. 0.1% PAC 용액은 1000mL 중 1g, 즉 1mL 중 1mg의 PAC를 포함하고 있습니다. 따라서 12mL의 0.1% PAC 용액은 12mg의 PAC를 포함하고 있습니다.

원수 200mL에 12mg의 PAC가 첨가되었으므로, 1L (1000mL)에는 얼마나 많은 PAC가 첨가되는지 계산해야 합니다. 200mL에 12mg이므로, 1000mL에는 (12mg / 200mL) * 1000mL = 60mg의 PAC가 첨가됩니다.

따라서 상수원수에 대한 PAC 용액 사용량은 60 mg"

1. 리벳의 전단응력 계산:
   - 리벳의 직경(∅) = 19mm
   - 리벳의 반경(r) = 19/2 = 9.5mm
   - 리벳의 단면적(A) = πr² = π(9.5)² = 283.53 mm²
   - 허용 전단응력 = 110MPa = 110 N/mm²
   - 리벳 하나당 전단응력에 의한 허용 하중 = 283.53 mm² x 110 N/mm² = 31188.3 N = 31.188 kN

2. 리벳의 지압응력 계산:
   - 판두께(t) = 10mm
   - 리벳의 지압면적 = d x t = 19mm x 10mm = 190 mm²

부지 부피 = 길이 × 너비 × 높이 = 20m × 10m × 5m = 1000m³

공극체적은 부지 부피의 평균공극률을 곱한 값입니다:
공극체적 = 부지 부피 × 평균공극률 = 1000m³ × 0.3 = 300m³

바이오벤팅법에서 필요한 총 공기량은 공극체적의 100배입니다:
필요한 총 공기량 = 공극체적 × 100 = 300m³ × 100 = 30000m³

다음으로, 인장하중을 단위 변환하여 kg으로 계산합니다. 10ton은 10000kg입니다.

이제, 실제 인장 응력을 계산합니다. 인장 응력 = 하중 / 단면적 = 10000kg / 0.785cm² = 12738.85kg/cm².

마지막으로, 안전여유를 계산합니다. 안전여유 = 재료의 인장강도 / 실제 인장 응력 = 18000kg/cm² / 12738.85kg/cm² ≈ 1.41.

해설 (Explanation):
펌프의 소요동력을 계산하기 위해 다음 공식을 사용할 수 있습니다:
\[ \text{소요동력 (kW)} = \frac{Q \times H \times \rho \times g}{\eta \times 1000} \]
여기서,
- \( Q \)는 펌프의 유량 (300ℓ/min, 0.3 m³/min)
- \( H \)는 전양정 (60m)
- \( \rho \)는 물의 밀도 (약 1000 kg/m³)
- \( g \)는 중력가속도 (약 9.81 m/s²)
- \( \eta \)는 펌프 효율 (70%, 0.7)

먼저, 펌프의 소요동력을 계산합니다:
\[ \text{소요동력} = \frac{0.3 \times 60 \times 1000 \times 9.81}{0"

Construction,D,,"오일러의 임계 하중 공식은 다음과 같습니다:
\[ P_{cr} = \frac{\pi^2 E I}{L^2} \]
여기서,
- \( E \)는 탄성계수 (70 GPa = 70 x 10^9 Pa),
- \( I \)는 단면 2차 모멘트,
- \( L \)은 기둥의 길이 (1.8 m).

정사각형 단면의 2차 모멘트 \( I \)는:
\[ I = \frac{a^4}{12} \]
여기서 \( a \)는 정사각형의 한 변의 길이입니다. 따라서,
\[ a = 25 \text{ mm} = 0.025 \text{ m} \]
\[ I = \frac{(0.025)^4}{12} = \frac{0.000015625}{12} = 0.000001302083 \text{ m}^4 \]

설명:
보의 총 하중은 자중과 적재하중의 합으로 계산됩니다. 자중은 1.0kN/m, 적재하중은 1.2kN/m이므로 총 하중은 1.0 + 1.2 = 2.2kN/m입니다.
단순보의 최대 휨모멘트는 M = wL^2 / 8 공식을 사용하여 계산할 수 있습니다. 여기서 w는 단위 길이당 하중이고, L은 스팬 길이입니다.
M = (2.2kN/m)(6m)^2 / 8 = 9.9kNㆍm입니다.
따라서 가장 가까운 옵션은 C: 13.4kNㆍm입니다."

건물의 취득가격은 1,000,000원이고, 취득중개수수료 100,000원을 포함하여 총 취득비용은 1,100,000원이다. 내용연수가 5년이고 잔존가치가 없으므로, 감가상각비는 총 취득비용을 내용연수로 나누어 계산한다.

1,100,000원 ÷ 5년 = 220,000원/년

따라서, 2017년 한 해 동안의 감가상각비는 220,000원이다."

취득가격 = 650,000원
잔존가치 = 50,000원
내용연수 = 5년

감가상각비 = (650,000원 - 50,000원) / 5년 = 600,000원 / 5년 = 120,000원/년

감가상각비를 월별로 계산하면,
120,000원 / 12개월 = 10,000원/월

2013년 9월 30일까지의 감가상각 기간은 2012년 1월 1일부터 2013년 9월 30일까지 총 21개월입니다.
